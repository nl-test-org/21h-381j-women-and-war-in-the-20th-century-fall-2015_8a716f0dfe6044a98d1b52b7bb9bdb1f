### Discussion Questions

Students will post on the class website one discussion question every week. These questions are graded. "Discussion questions" should be based on the given day's readings and are meant to stimulate discussion, intellectual curiosity, and engagement. Please avoid factual questions. The length of the question may vary but cannot exceed three sentences. You might introduce your question by telling why you began thinking about this question, what you found puzzling about this particular topic and why, and how / if you relate to it personally.

### Final

There is no final exam but a final research paper on a topic of your choice that pertains to women / gender and war. Students should decide on their topics by the end of the Thanksgiving break and inform the professor by Session 11. The paper is due two weeks after the last class. No late-submissions.
